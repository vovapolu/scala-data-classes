**STATUS: currently implementing, not released yet. This project is sponsored by the [Scala Google Summer of Code](https://github.com/scala/scala-lang/blob/master/gsoc/2017.md#case-classes-a-la-carte-with-scalameta)**

An alternative to `case class` and extensions for `sealed trait` giving much more control over the internal representation of ADTs for [Functional Programming in Scala](https://leanpub.com/fp-scala-mortals) style.

The following features are currently being considered in [`src/test/scala/testing`](https://github.com/fommil/stalagmite/tree/master/src/test/scala/testing). If you have any further ideas, please comment on the issue tracker:

## `final case class` parity

```scala
@data(product = true, checkSerializable = false /*, companionExtends = true */)
class Foo[+T](a: Boolean, s: String, t: T, i: Int = 0)
```

should give feature parity with

```scala
final case class Foo[+T] private (a: Boolean, s: String, t: T, i: Int = 0)
```

Extending `trait` / `interface` is allowed, but extending `class` / `abstract class` is forbidden.

User-defined methods and fields are being debated in [#5](https://github.com/fommil/stalagmite/issues/5).

- `product` (i.e. implementing `Product`) will be disabled by default because it encourages runtime inspection instead of compiletime safety.
- `checkSerializable` (i.e. checking all parameters for `Serializable`) will be enabled by default because this is the sort of thing that should be checked at compiletime.
- `companionExtends` disabled by default and not possible for non-parametric classes, makes the companion extend a function. [Has binary compatibility consequences](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-3664).

Implicit instances of `shapeless.{Generic, LabelledGeneric, Typeable}` are generated on the companion. This saves shapeless from having to derive one at every call site, speeding up downstream compiles.

## Memoisation

Memoisation uses best endeavours to re-use existing instances instead of creating new ones.

High levels of memoisation in a JVM mean that the overall heap size for a `class` can be **dramatically** reduced in some cases, but at the cost of extra CPU cycles during construction and GC pressure. Also, the incidence of instance-based equality hits go up (so `equals` can get faster!).

```scala
@data(memoise = true, memoiseRefs = Seq('s), memoiseHashCode = true, memoiseToString = true, memoiseStrong = true)
class Foo(a: Boolean, s: String)
```

The following features are independent, but can be combined:

- `memoise` uses an interner cache to reduce duplication on the heap (at the cost of lookup and GC pressure)
- `memoiseRefs` (takes `Seq[Symbol]`) uses a memoisation cache for the selected `AnyRef` fields (at the cost of lookup and GC pressure)
- `memoizeStringsIntern` false by default, special-cases `String` fields to use the JVM's `intern` (trumps `memoiseRefs`)
- `memoiseHashCode` stores the `hashCode` in a `val`, and uses this as a shortcut in `equals` (at the cost of initialisation and heap)
- `memoiseToString` stores the `toString` in a `val` (at the cost of initialisation and heap)
- `memoiseStrong` weak by default, means your instances are never garbage collected and `equals` is identity based (extreme caution!)

Further ideas for memoisation should go in [#6](https://github.com/fommil/stalagmite/issues/6)

### Implementation Note

It is not possible to write a cache on the JVM whose contents are garbage collected *iff* no longer referenced by anywhere else in the system:

1. the user could be using weak / soft references.
2. experiments showed that `WeakHashMap` is aggressively cleaned even when its keys are strongly referenced elsewhere. This may be a general problem with `WeakReference` and `SoftReference` (the latter to a lesser extent, but still without guarantees).

Value and identity equivalence can only be guaranteed if a strong reference cache is used. The JVM would have to offer native support or GC hooks for this to work.

See [#8](https://github.com/fommil/stalagmite/issues/8) for a way of speeding up `equals` for instances with value equality (but not reference equality), at the cost of even more heap.

We are using Guava's `{Weak,String}Interner` to implement memoisation, but what we really want is a `SoftReference` interner that uses a custom `Equality`.

## Optimise Heap

```scala
@data(optimiseHeapOptions = true, optimiseHeapStrings = true)
class Foo(a: Option[Boolean], b: Option[Boolean], s: Option[String])
```

- `optimiseHeapOptions` stores `Option` `AnyRef`s as `null`-able fields and a (shared) bitmask for `AnyVal`s. Does not allow `null` or `Some(null)`.
- `optimiseHeapBooleans` re-uses the (shared) bitmask for bit packing of `Boolean` parameters
- `optimiseHeapStrings` unwraps `String` as `Array[Char]`, saving 64 bits per `String` field per instance (at the cost of object churn and `String.{hashCode,equals}` performance)

For this example: 3 `Option` wrappers, `Boolean` boxing, `Boolean` packing, `String` wrapping, we save 6 references (384 bits) per instance.

Note that changing the heap representation does not affect the serialised form (the public visible fields are used).
